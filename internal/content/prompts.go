}

func workflowProposal(name string) string {
	cn := changeArg(name)
	return `## Stage 1: Proposal (Why)

The proposal captures the **intent** of the change — why it needs to happen.

### Steps

1. **Create the change** (if not done yet):
   Call ` + "`spec_new`" + ` with name="` + cn + `" and provide a clear intent.

2. **Add the proposal artifact**:
   Call ` + "`spec_artifact`" + ` with:
   - change_name="` + cn + `"
   - artifact_type="proposal"
   - Provide: intent (required), scope, and impact

3. **Review**: The proposal should answer:
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who is affected?
   - What is the expected impact?

4. **Mark ready**: Once reviewed, call ` + "`spec_mark_ready`" + ` with the proposal's entity_id.
   The proposal must be marked **ready** before you can add specs.

### Guardrails
- Change name must be **kebab-case** (hard block)
- A **Constitution** must exist (hard block — use ` + "`spec_create_constitution`" + ` to bootstrap)
- **Patterns** should be seeded (soft block, override with force=true)

### Tips
- Use ` + "`spec_status`" + ` with change_id to see readiness state and next steps at any time.

### Next stage
Once the proposal is **ready**, move to **specs** stage.
`
}

func workflowSpecs(name string) string {
	cn := changeArg(name)
	return `## Stage 2: Specs (What)

Specs define **what** the change needs to do. Each spec is a domain-specific container holding requirements and scenarios.

### Steps

1. **Add spec(s)**:
   Call ` + "`spec_artifact`" + ` with:
   - change_name="` + cn + `"
   - artifact_type="spec"
   - Provide: name, domain, purpose, delta_type

2. **Add requirements** to each spec:
   Call ` + "`spec_artifact`" + ` with artifact_type="requirement"
   - Provide: name, description, strength (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)

3. **Add scenarios** to requirements:
   Call ` + "`spec_artifact`" + ` with artifact_type="scenario"
   - Provide: name, given/when/then (BDD format)

4. **Mark ready (bottom-up)**: Readiness cascades upward, so mark children ready first:
   - Mark each **Scenario** ready: ` + "`spec_mark_ready`" + ` with entity_id
   - Mark each **Requirement** ready (requires all its Scenarios to be ready)
   - Mark each **Spec** ready (requires all its Requirements to be ready)
   If any child is not ready, the parent will be blocked with a list of unready children.

### Guardrails
- Proposal must be **ready** before adding specs (hard block)
- Each requirement should have at least one scenario
- Adding a new Requirement to a ready Spec reverts the Spec to **draft**
- Adding a new Scenario to a ready Requirement reverts the Requirement to **draft**

### Tips
- Use ` + "`spec_status`" + ` to see which specs/requirements/scenarios still need to be marked ready.

### Next stage
Once all specs are **ready**, move to **design** stage.
`
}

func workflowDesign(name string) string {
	cn := changeArg(name)
	return `## Stage 3: Design (How)

The design describes **how** the specs will be implemented.

### Steps

1. **Add the design**:
   Call ` + "`spec_artifact`" + ` with:
   - change_name="` + cn + `"
   - artifact_type="design"
   - Provide: approach, decisions, data_flow, file_changes

2. **Check patterns**: Call ` + "`spec_suggest_patterns`" + ` to see which patterns apply
3. **Apply patterns**: Call ` + "`spec_apply_pattern`" + ` for each relevant pattern

4. **Mark ready**: Once reviewed, call ` + "`spec_mark_ready`" + ` with the design's entity_id.
   The design must be marked **ready** before you can add tasks.

### Guardrails
- Proposal must be **ready** and all specs must be **ready** before adding a design (hard block)
- Design should reference existing patterns where applicable

### Next stage
Once the design is **ready**, move to **tasks** stage.
`
}

func workflowTasks(name string) string {
	cn := changeArg(name)
	return `## Stage 4: Tasks (Steps)

Tasks break the design into concrete, implementable steps.

### Steps

1. **Generate tasks** (recommended):
   Call ` + "`spec_generate_tasks`" + ` with change_name="` + cn + `"
   This auto-generates tasks from the design.

2. **Or add manually**:
   Call ` + "`spec_artifact`" + ` with artifact_type="task"
   - Provide: number, description, task_type, complexity_points (1-10)

3. **Set dependencies**: Tasks can block other tasks using the blocks/blocked_by relationship

4. **View critical path**: Call ` + "`spec_get_critical_path`" + ` to see the dependency chain

### Guardrails
- A **design must be ready** before adding tasks (hard block)
- Complexity uses **1-10 points**, NOT hours

### Next stage
Once tasks are defined, move to **implement** stage.
`
}

func workflowImplement(name string) string {
	cn := changeArg(name)
	return `## Stage 5: Implement

Work through tasks in dependency order.

### Steps

1. **Get available tasks**: Call ` + "`spec_get_available_tasks`" + ` with change_name="` + cn + `"
   Returns tasks whose dependencies are satisfied.

2. **Assign a task**: Call ` + "`spec_assign_task`" + ` to claim a task

3. **Complete a task**: Call ` + "`spec_complete_task`" + ` when done
   - Provide: verification_notes and artifacts (files changed)

4. **Repeat** until all tasks are complete

### Tips
- Use ` + "`spec_impact_analysis`" + ` to understand ripple effects
- Use ` + "`spec_get_patterns`" + ` to check pattern compliance
- Use ` + "`spec_validate_constitution`" + ` to verify against project principles

### Next stage
Once all tasks are complete, move to **archive** stage.
`
}

func workflowArchive(name string) string {
	cn := changeArg(name)
	return `## Stage 6: Archive

Finalize and archive the completed change.

### Steps

1. **Verify the change**: Call ` + "`spec_verify`" + ` with change_name="` + cn + `"
   Checks completeness, correctness, and coherence.

2. **Address any issues**: Fix warnings and suggestions from verification

3. **Archive**: Call ` + "`spec_archive`" + ` with change_name="` + cn + `"

### Guardrails
- All core artifacts should exist (soft block)
- All tasks should be completed (soft block)
- Override with force=true if needed

### Done!
The change is now archived with full traceability in the knowledge graph.

const guideFull = `# SpecMCP — Spec-Driven Development via MCP

## What is SpecMCP?

SpecMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides **spec-driven development workflow** backed by a knowledge graph. Instead of managing specifications as scattered files, SpecMCP stores all artifacts — proposals, specs, requirements, scenarios, designs, tasks, patterns, and constitutions — as graph entities with typed relationships.

This enables:
- **Traceability**: Every requirement traces to scenarios, design decisions, and tasks
- **Impact analysis**: Understand what's affected when something changes
- **Dependency management**: Tasks with explicit blocking relationships and critical path analysis
- **Pattern enforcement**: Reusable patterns with automatic detection and compliance checking
- **Guardrails**: Automated checks at every stage to prevent workflow mistakes

## Core Concept: Artifact Workflow

Every change follows a structured progression:

` + "```" + `
Proposal (Why) → Specs (What) → Design (How) → Tasks (Steps)
` + "```" + `

Each stage builds on the previous one, enforced by guardrails:
- You cannot add specs without a **ready** proposal
- You cannot add a design without a **ready** proposal and all specs **ready**
- You cannot add tasks without a **ready** design

## Entity Model

SpecMCP uses 18 entity types and 30+ relationship types. Key entities:

| Entity | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Change** | Top-level container for a feature, fix, or refactoring |
| **Proposal** | Intent — why the change exists |
| **Spec** | Domain-specific specification container |
| **Requirement** | Specific behavior the system must have |
| **Scenario** | BDD-style example (Given/When/Then) |
| **Design** | Technical approach — how specs will be implemented |
| **Task** | Implementable step with complexity, status, blocking |
| **Pattern** | Reusable implementation convention |
| **Constitution** | Project-wide principles and guardrails |
| **Actor** | User role or persona |
| **Context** | Screen, page, or interaction surface |
| **UIComponent** | Reusable UI component |
| **Action** | User action or system operation |
| **TestCase** | Executable test linked to a scenario |
| **APIContract** | Machine-readable API definition |
| **CodingAgent** | Developer or AI agent |

## Guardrails

SpecMCP enforces guardrails at three points:

### Pre-Change Guards (spec_new)
| Guard | Severity | What it checks |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| kebab_case_name | HARD_BLOCK | Change name must be kebab-case |
| constitution_required | HARD_BLOCK | Project should have a constitution |
| patterns_seeded | SOFT_BLOCK | Project should have patterns |
| context_discovery | SUGGESTION | Contexts should be mapped |
| component_discovery | SUGGESTION | Components should be mapped |

### Artifact Guards (spec_artifact)
| Guard | Severity | What it checks |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| proposal_before_spec | HARD_BLOCK | Proposal required before specs |
| spec_before_design | HARD_BLOCK | Specs required before design |
| design_before_tasks | HARD_BLOCK | Design required before tasks |

### Archive Guards (spec_archive)
| Guard | Severity | What it checks |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| artifact_completeness | SOFT_BLOCK | All core artifacts should exist |
| task_completion | SOFT_BLOCK | All tasks should be completed |

**Severity levels**:
- **HARD_BLOCK**: Cannot proceed. Fix the issue first.
- **SOFT_BLOCK**: Should not proceed. Use force=true to override.
- **WARNING**: Advisory — action recommended but not required.
- **SUGGESTION**: Informational tip.

   - Create constitution: ` + "`spec_create_constitution`" + ` (no change_id required)

2. **Start a change**:
   - ` + "`spec_new`" + ` with a kebab-case name

3. **Define the change** (follow the artifact workflow):
   - Proposal → mark ready → Specs → Requirements → Scenarios → mark ready (bottom-up) → Design → mark ready → Tasks
   - Use ` + "`spec_status`" + ` to check readiness and see next steps at any stage

4. **Implement**:
   - Work through tasks in dependency order using task management tools

5. **Verify and archive**:
   - ` + "`spec_verify`" + ` to check completeness
   - ` + "`spec_archive`" + ` to finalize
`

const guideWorkflowSection = `# SpecMCP Artifact Workflow

Every change follows a structured artifact progression, each stage building on the previous:

## Readiness Gating

Workflow progression is gated on **readiness**, not just existence. Each workflow artifact (Proposal, Spec, Requirement, Scenario, Design) has a status of **draft** or **ready**.

- New artifacts start as **draft**
- Use ` + "`spec_mark_ready`" + ` to mark an artifact as **ready**
- Readiness cascades: a Spec can't be ready unless all its Requirements are ready; a Requirement can't be ready unless all its Scenarios are ready
- Adding a child to a ready parent (e.g., a new Requirement to a ready Spec) automatically reverts the parent to **draft**
- Use ` + "`spec_status`" + ` to see overall readiness and next steps

## Proposal (Why)
Captures the **intent** — why this change needs to happen.
- Fields: intent (required), scope, impact
- Created via: spec_artifact with artifact_type="proposal"
- Must be marked **ready** before adding specs

## Specs (What)
Define **what** the change does. Each spec is a domain-specific container.
- Fields: name, domain, purpose, delta_type
- Contains: Requirements (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- Requirements contain: Scenarios (Given/When/Then BDD format)
- Mark ready **bottom-up**: Scenarios → Requirements → Specs

## Design (How)
Describes **how** specs will be implemented.
- Fields: approach, decisions, data_flow, file_changes
- Should reference applicable patterns
- Must be marked **ready** before adding tasks

## Tasks (Steps)
Break the design into concrete, implementable steps.
- Fields: number, description, task_type, complexity_points (1-10)
- Relationships: blocks/blocked_by (auto-bidirectional), has_subtask, assigned_to
- Auto-generation available via spec_generate_tasks

## Enforcement
The workflow order is enforced by readiness-based guardrails:
- Specs require a **ready** Proposal (hard block)
- Design requires **ready** Proposal + all Specs **ready** (hard block)
- Tasks require a **ready** Design (hard block)
`

const guideGuardrailsSection = `# SpecMCP Guardrails

Guardrails are automated checks that run at key points in the workflow to prevent mistakes.

## Severity Levels

| Level | Meaning | Override |
|-------|---------|---------|
| HARD_BLOCK | Cannot proceed | Must fix the issue |
| SOFT_BLOCK | Should not proceed | Use force=true to override |
| WARNING | Advisory | Action recommended |
| SUGGESTION | Informational | No action required |

## Pre-Change Guards (run on spec_new)
1. **kebab_case_name** [HARD_BLOCK] — Name must be lowercase letters, digits, hyphens
2. **constitution_required** [HARD_BLOCK] — Project must have a constitution (use spec_create_constitution)
3. **patterns_seeded** [SOFT_BLOCK] — Project should have patterns seeded
4. **context_discovery** [SUGGESTION] — Map interaction surfaces first
5. **component_discovery** [SUGGESTION] — Map reusable components first

## Artifact Guards (run on spec_artifact)

These guards check **readiness**, not just existence. Use ` + "`spec_mark_ready`" + ` to mark artifacts as ready.

1. **proposal_before_spec** [HARD_BLOCK] — Proposal must be **ready** before adding specs
2. **spec_before_design** [HARD_BLOCK] — Proposal must be **ready** and all specs must be **ready** before adding design
3. **design_before_tasks** [HARD_BLOCK] — Design must be **ready** before adding tasks

## Archive Guards (run on spec_archive)
1. **artifact_completeness** [SOFT_BLOCK] — All core artifacts should exist
2. **task_completion** [SOFT_BLOCK] — All tasks should be completed

## Verification (spec_verify)
Three-dimensional check:
1. **Completeness** — Do all required artifacts exist? Are tasks done?
2. **Correctness** — Do requirements map to scenarios? Is coverage sufficient?
3. **Coherence** — Does implementation follow the design and patterns?

`

const guidePatternsSection = `# SpecMCP Patterns

Patterns are reusable implementation conventions stored in the knowledge graph. They capture recurring decisions so teams stay consistent.

## Pattern Types
- **naming** — Naming conventions (files, variables, types)
- **structural** — Code organization and architecture
- **behavioral** — Runtime behavior patterns (error handling, logging)
- **testing** — Test organization and coverage patterns
- **security** — Security-related conventions
- **api** — API design conventions

## Built-in Patterns (15)
SpecMCP ships with 15 built-in patterns covering common conventions:
- Kebab-case file naming, PascalCase types, camelCase functions
- Error handling with wrapped errors
- Repository pattern for data access
- Input validation at boundaries
- Structured logging
- Test naming conventions
- And more

Seed them with: spec_seed_patterns

## Pattern Workflow
1. **Seed** built-in patterns (spec_seed_patterns)
2. **Discover** patterns from existing code during sync
3. **Suggest** applicable patterns for a change (spec_suggest_patterns)
4. **Apply** patterns to link them (spec_apply_pattern)
5. **Enforce** via constitution (requires_pattern / forbids_pattern relationships)

## Constitution Integration
A Constitution can mandate or forbid patterns:
- **requires_pattern**: Change must use this pattern
- **forbids_pattern**: Change must not use this pattern
Use spec_validate_constitution to check compliance.
